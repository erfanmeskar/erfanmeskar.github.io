I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Toronto, working with Professor Ben Liang and a sessional instrcutor at Computer Science Department and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Toronto. My research interests lie in game theory, mechanism design, social and economic network, and machine learning.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022 at University of Toronto, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Ben Liang. From 2022 to 2025, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Toronto, and taught and coordinated various courses. Prior to my Ph.D., I received a M.A.Sc in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McMaster University, and a B.Sc. in the Department of Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology.
